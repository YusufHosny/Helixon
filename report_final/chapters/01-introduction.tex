\chapter{Introduction}
In the context of the Helixon project (Hybrid, efficient, and liquid interpolation of sound in extended reality), a vital part of a sound interpolation system is the head-tracking system through which the sound interpolation system derives its behavior from. As such, in this paper we intend to explore a specific research question:\par
RQ: How can head position and orientation be efficiently estimated and tracked? \par
In our investigation of this question, we will present our research on various methods for position and orientation estimation and our results and evaluations of the different methods. Furthermore, we will present the Helixon dataset collected during the course of the research, and explore the methods of data collection, preprocessing, calibration, and synchronization used in creating the dataset.
